This is examples/connection/README.

The connection example implements two parts of the connection establishing
process:
- a server which will be waiting for incoming connections using single RPMA
endpoint
- a client which will initialize establishing the connection to the server

Note: This example after establishing the connection just disconnects. For
examples how to make real use of the connection please see other examples.
