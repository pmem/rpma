Example of using messaging with shared RQ
===

The messages ping pong example with shared RQ implements two parts of the messaging process:
- The server starts a listening endpoint and waits for multiple incoming connections.
When a new connection request appears it is accepted. The client sends to the server
its current counter value. When the server receives the message from the client,
its content is incremented and send back to the client. When the server receives
the I_M_DONE message it disconnects.
- The client connects to the server and sends to it its current counter value.
When the client gets the new value from the server it repeats the process for
the configured number of rounds. When it is quitting, it sends the I_M_DONE
message and waits for disconnection.

**Note**: The server will end listening when no new connection request appears after 6 seconds.

## Usage

```bash
[user@server]$ ./server $server_address $port
```

```bash
[user@client]$ ./client $server_address $port $seed $rounds [<sleep>]
```
