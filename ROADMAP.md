# The librpma roadmap [04/08/2021]
After the initial stage of development and having a growing community of developers we have decided to move the librpma roadmap fully on GitHub. We are planning to post and discuss ideas about future improvements of the library there.

Please join us at: https://github.com/pmem/rpma/issues if you find any of the items listed there interesting for you (either you expect this item to be added to the library or you would like to deliver a source code solution for it).

**Note**: Please take a look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before you start developing.

# The librpma Fio engine roadmap [04/08/2021]
The librpma FIO engine is already out there. Please give it a try: https://github.com/axboe/fio

In the meantime, we are still working on new concepts and improvements to the existing engines.

If you feel the vibe, please join us here: https://github.com/pmem/fio
