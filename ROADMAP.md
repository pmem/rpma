# The librpma roadmap [04/08/2021]
After the initial stage of development and having a growing community of developers we have decided to move the librpma roadmap fully on GitHub. We are planning to posting there and discussing ideas for future improvements to the library.

Please join us: https://github.com/pmem/rpma/issues

# The librpma Fio engine roadmap [04/08/2021]
The librpma FIO engine is already out there. Please give it a try: https://github.com/axboe/fio

In the meantime, we are still working on new concepts and improvements to the existing engines.

If you feel the vibe, please join us here: https://github.com/pmem/fio
