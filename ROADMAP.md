# **librpma roadmap [23/07/2020]**

This document presents the librpma library roadmap as it shaped on 07/23/2020. It lists high-level features that are going to be released with the library release 1.0.
This roadmap is for informational purposes only, so you should not rely on this information for purchasing or planning decisions. Just like all projects, the items in the roadmap are subject to change or delay, and the continued development or release of a feature on the roadmap is at the sole discretion of the librpma development team.
