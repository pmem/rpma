# DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT SETTINGS

## Configuring CMake options

CMake creates many cache files and subdirectories in the directory where it is run, so it is recommended to run all CMake-related commands (like `cmake` and `ccmake`)  in a separate newly created subdirectory usually called `build`:

```sh
[rpma]$ mkdir build
[rpma]$ cd build
[rpma/build]$ cmake ..
```

All examples listed below use the `build` subdirectory as the CMake build directory.

CMake options can be changed using the `-D` option e.g.:

```sh
[rpma/build]$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBUILD_DEVELOPER_MODE=ON ..
```

You can browse and edit the CMake options using `cmake-gui` or `ccmake` e.g.:

```sh
[rpma/build]$ ccmake ..
```

[rpma/build]$ cmake -LAH ..
```

### CMake options most useful during development

The most useful CMake options during development are briefly described below:
- `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` should be set to `Debug` (the default is `Release`) to be able to run the tests and see the debug information in case of failures,
- `BUILD_DEVELOPER_MODE` should be set to `ON` (the default is `OFF`) to enable all developer checks (checking: licenses, coding style, whitespaces and commits), it sets also two compiler flags: `-Wall` and `-Werror`,
- `BUILD_DOC` should be set to `ON` (the default) to turn on building the documentation,
- `BUILD_TESTS` should be set to `ON` (the default) to turn on building the tests,
- `BUILD_EXAMPLES` should be set to `ON` (the default) to turn on building the examples,
- `TESTS_RDMA_CONNECTION` should be set to `ON` (the default is `OFF`) to enable tests that require a configured RDMA-capable network interface (valgrind is also required),
- `TESTS_VERBOSE_OUTPUT` should be set to `ON` (the default is `OFF`) to put cmake in the trace mode with variables expanded,
- `DEBUG_LOG_TRACE` enables logging functions' traces, so it is very useful during debugging (it should be set to `ON` then, the default is `OFF`).

# Testing

This section describes how to prepare the environment for execution of all available kinds of tests:
- unit tests,
- multi-threaded (MT) tests and
- integration tests.

## Running only the unit tests

The unit tests are implemented using the [cmocka](https://cmocka.org/) framework. They do not need any RDMA-capable network interface. All unit tests are located in the `./tests/unit/` subfolder of the main directory.

In order to run **only** the unit tests (this is the default configuration):
1. Build the librpma library with the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` CMake variable set to `Debug` and the `TESTS_RDMA_CONNECTION` CMake variable set to `OFF`:

```sh
[rpma]$ cd build
[rpma/build]$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DTESTS_RDMA_CONNECTION=OFF ..
[rpma/build]$ make -j$(nproc)
```

or just:

```sh
[rpma]$ cd build; rm -rf ./*
[rpma/build]$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
[rpma/build]$ make -j$(nproc)
```

in the empty `build` subfolder.

2. Run tests from the `build` subdirectory:

```sh
[rpma/build]$ make test
```

or:

```sh
[rpma/build]$ ctest --output-on-failure
```

to print out the output of the failed tests too.

## Running multi-threaded or integration tests on SoftRoCE or RDMA HW

**Note**: The analysis of thread safety of the librpma library is located in the [THREAD_SAFETY.md](THREAD_SAFETY.md) file.

### Preparing the environment

In order to run the multi-threaded or the integration tests:
1. Make sure you have all needed packages installed (you can support yourself with [Dockerfiles](./utils/docker/images/) (see the EXAMPLES_DEPS section)).
2. Valgrind must be installed to run both the multi-threaded and the integration tests.
3. A correctly configured RDMA-capable network interface (SoftRoCE or RDMA HW) with an IP address assigned is required.
4. If SoftRoCE is to be used to run tests, it can be configured in the following two alternative ways (it also prints out the IP of the configured interface):

```sh
[rpma]$ ./tools/config_softroce.sh
```

or:

```sh
[rpma/build]$ cmake ..
[rpma/build]$ make config_softroce
```

5. Set the `RPMA_TESTING_IP` environment variable to an IP address of this interface:

```sh
$ export RPMA_TESTING_IP=192.168.0.1 # insert your own IP address here
```

### Building the librpma library for running multi-threaded or integration tests

1. In order to run the **multi-threaded tests** build the librpma library with the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` CMake variable set to `Debug` and the `TESTS_RDMA_CONNECTION` CMake variable set to `ON`:

```sh
[rpma]$ cd build
[rpma/build]$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DTESTS_RDMA_CONNECTION=ON ..
[rpma/build]$ make -j$(nproc)
```

2. In order to run the **integration tests** build the librpma library with the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` CMake variable set to `Debug` and the `TESTS_RDMA_CONNECTION` and the `DEBUG_FAULT_INJECTION` CMake variables set to `ON`:

```sh
[rpma]$ cd build
[rpma/build]$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DTESTS_RDMA_CONNECTION=ON -DDEBUG_FAULT_INJECTION=ON ..
[rpma/build]$ make -j$(nproc)
```

### Running unit and multi-threaded tests

In order to run both: unit and multi-threaded tests, run the following command:

```sh
[rpma/build]$ make test
```

or:

```sh
[rpma/build]$ ctest --output-on-failure
```

to print out also the output of the failed tests.

### Running only multi-threaded tests

In order to run **only** the multi-threaded tests, run the following command:

```sh
[rpma/build]$ ctest -R mtt --output-on-failure
```

### Running integration tests

The integration tests are implemented as examples run together with the fault injection mechanism. 

The integration tests can be started using one of the following commands:
1. From the build directory:

```sh
[rpma/build]$ make run_all_examples_with_fault_injection
```

or:

2. From the main directory of the librpma repository:

```sh
[rpma]$ ./examples/run-all-examples.sh ./build/examples/ --integration-tests
```

In order to run the integration tests on a PMem (a DAX device or a file on a file system DAX), an absolute path (starting with `/`) to this PMem has to be provided either via the `<pmem-path>` argument:

```sh
[rpma]$ ./examples/run-all-examples.sh ./build/examples/ --integration-tests <pmem-path>
```

or via the `RPMA_EXAMPLES_PMEM_PATH` environment variable. If both of them are set, the command line argument `<pmem-path>` will be used.

By default the integration tests do not stop on a failure. In order to stop on the first failure, the `RPMA_EXAMPLES_STOP_ON_FAILURE` environment variable has to be set to `ON` or the following command has to be run:

```sh
[rpma]$ ./examples/run-all-examples.sh ./build/examples/ --integration-tests --stop-on-failure
```

To see all available configuration options please take a look at the help message printed out by the following command:

```sh
[rpma]$ ./examples/run-all-examples.sh
```
