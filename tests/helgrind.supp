#
# The following suppressions are suited for debug build
# of librpma on Ubuntu 22.04 used in the CircleCI.
# They may not work for any other OS, OS version,
# rdma-core version and for the release build.
#

#
# All suppressions should follow the following format:
#
# Assessment: (XXX - to mark assessment that is not done yet)
#
# This suppression indicates a lack of MT safety.
#
# OS: a version of OS
# OFED: a version of OFED if used
# libibverbs: a version of libibverbs
# librdmacm: a version of librdmacm
# rdma-core: a version of the 'rdma-core' package if installed
#
# Occurs in traces of:
# - a function name of public API of librpma
#
# There are 3 types of suppressions:
#
# 1) general one (on an external API)
# {
#    Possible data race during write of size 4
#    Helgrind:Race
#    ...
#    fun:ibv_dontfork_range
#    ...
# }
#
# 2) explicit librpma API call
# {
#    Possible data race during write of size 4
#    Helgrind:Race
#    ...
#    fun:rpma_conn_cfg_set_timeout
#    ...
# }
#
# 3) detailed external one (on an external API)

#    fun:funA
#    fun:funB
