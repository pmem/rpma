 * example.c -- an example of a multithreaded test
 *
 * An example showing how to use the multithreaded test API (mtt_*).
 * The test itself does a very simple thing of rewriting input to the output
 * using an intermediate temp variable (of course it is nonsensical).
 * The test runs as follow:
 * - prestate_init - picks an arbitrary seed
 * - seq_init      - sequentially allocates and initializes states for all of
 *                   the threads
 * - init          - in parallel all of the threads allocate a temp variable for
 *                   themselves
 * - thread        - rewrite input to the temp variable
 * - fini          - in parallel rewrites temp to the output and frees the temp
 *                   variable
 * - seq_fini      - sequentially prints the output of each of the threads and
 *                   frees their states
 * - prestate_fini - zero out the seed
