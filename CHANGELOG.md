  unneeded '*' at the start of the grep expressions

## [0.9.0] - 2020-10-01
### Added
- This is the first official release of the librpma library.
- The API provides the most flexible implementation of remote persistency
via Appliance Persistency Method.
- Multiple examples show how to use this API (including an example of how to
build your own General Purpose Persistency Method implementation basing on
the services provided by the librpma library).
- The extensive documentation describes all guiding principles.
