## More Info

[Persistent Memory Over Traditional RDMA White Paper - Part 1](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/persistent-memory-replication-over-traditional-rdma-part-1-understanding-remote-persistent.html) - which describes a technology behind RPMA. **Note:** Parts 2-4 relates directly to the librpmem library which is a predecessor of librpma. So parts 2-4 do not relate exactly to how librpma works.
