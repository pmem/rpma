"""Controlling the benchmarking process related to a single series

A single series is a list of data points collected under well defined
benchmarking conditions when the given requirements are met.
A `lib.benchmark.base.Benchmark` is an entity working towards collecting
these data points so all the `lib.figure.base.Figure` instances which have
ordered the given series can collect their results.
