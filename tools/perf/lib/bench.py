class Bench:
    """A benchmarking control object

    To setup the benchmarking it needs:

    - `Bench.config` - the configuration of the benchmarking system
    - `Bench.parts` - the list of the names of all parts covered (for details
        on parts please see `lib`). To cover a part, the `Bench` object has to
        build all figures contained within the part.
    - `Bench.figures` - the combined list of figures coming from all parts.
        To cover a figure, the `Bench` object has to execute all series
        constituting it. Each of the series has its requirements hence it is
        more efficient to group them by requirements.
    - `Bench.requirements` - the dict of the requirements for all the series
        covered (for details on series please see `lib`). Each of
        the requirements contains a list of the series making the same
        requirement. For the efficiency purposes, the list of series within
        the requirement does not contain duplicates so a single series may be
        used later on in more than one figure.
    - `Bench.result_dir` - a directory where the intermediate and final
        products of the benchmarking process will be stored.

    When the `Bench` object is created its `Bench.run()` method should be
    used to execute the planned series. When it returns `True` all
    the data is collected and it can be further processed for the sake of
    visualisation and publication. Please see `report_figures` and
    `report_create` for details. When `Bench.run()` returns `False`
    the end-user has to pay attention to the standard output in order
    to learn how to adjust the configuration to complete all planned series.
