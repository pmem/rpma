<h2 id="cpuload">CPU load impact</h2>

Benchmarking an impact of the CPU load running on **the RPMA Target** on writing data persistently using both ways of achieving remote persistency: **APM**, **GPSPM-RT**, and **GPSPM**.

As a starting point are chosen well-performing workload configurations in respect of either latency or bandwidth. The CPU load on **the RPMA Target** is expected to affect all persistency methods requiring active participation of the process running on **the RPMA Target** namely **GPSPM-RT** and **GPSPM**. Whereas **APM** since it does not make use of the CPU of **the RPMA Target** should not be significantly affected.

<h3 id="cpuload-lat">CPU load impact: Latency</h3>

Comparing the latency of **APM** to PMem on **the RPMA Target** vs the latency of **GPSPM(-RT)** to PMem on **the RPMA Target** (with *Direct Write to PMem* disabled) affected by various CPU loads running on **the RPMA Target**.
