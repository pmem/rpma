##Remote Persistent Memory Optimized Access
In order to make the optimal use of your Remote Persistent Memory:

1) Make sure you have all following required HW components [[1]][start-1] and check: how many and what kind of those items do you have? Which socket/slot/channel are they located in?:
   - main system board supporting 2nd generation Intel速 Xeon速 Scalable processors,
   - 2nd generation Intel速 Xeon速 Scalable CPUs,
   - Intel&reg; Optane&trade; persistent memory modules,
   - DRAM DIMMs and
   - RDMA-capable NICs

2) Verify that you have the required Linux kernel version: the Linux NVDIMM/PMem drivers are enabled by default, starting with Linux mainline kernel 4.2. We recommend mainline kernel version 4.19 or later to deliver Reliability, Availability and Serviceability (RAS) features required by the Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK) [[2]][start-2]

3) Populate your DIMMs according to one of the recommended topologies as described in detail in the 1.2.4.1 chapter "Recommended Topologies" of "Intel&reg; Optane&trade; DC Persistent Memory Quick Start Guide" [[3]][start-3].

4) Configure your memory modules according to "Provision Intel&reg; Optane&trade; DC Persistent Memory in Linux" [[4]][start-4] and "Optimizing Memory Performance" [[5]][start-5] in order to configure your memory properly and optimize its performance.
