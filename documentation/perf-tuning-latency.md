# Performance - Tuning for latency (WIP)

A collection of best methods, practices, and configuration values known for delivering the smallest possible latency in a consistent and predictable way for the workloads build on the librpma library.

This guide is Work-in-progress.

## Disclaimer

TheÂ *Performance - Tuning for latency* aims to collect all tested and proven procedures with known beneficial effects on the latency of the workloads build based on the librpma library. Nonetheless, each configuration change should be set up and tested in a testing environment before being applied to a production system. Backing up all data and configuration settings prior to tuning is also recommended.
