# Direct write to PMem

It is substantial for any RPMEM application to even start using APM.

This guide is Work-in-progress.

**XXX** elaborate

## Intel® Data Direct I/O Technology (DDIO) [[1]][xxx-ddio]

**XXX** Here probably should go a part of the [DDIO - The journey to the datasheet and back][xxx-ddio] which describes why the user may be very interested in turning DDIO off on the per-PCIe Root Port basis.

## Prepare for direct write to PMem

It is hard to show a general way to obtain an address of the PCIe Root Port you desire. Let’s assume you have a Mellanox RDMA-capable Network Adapter plugged into PCIe slot. How to find out an address of PCIe Root Port of the Mellanox RNIC? If you ask me I will argue the simplest way is as follows:

```sh
$ lspci -vt | grep Mellanox
 +-[0000:17]-+-00.0-[18]--+-00.0  Mellanox Technologies MT27800 Family [ConnectX-5]
 |           |            \-00.1  Mellanox Technologies MT27800 Family [ConnectX-5]
```

The [lspci(8)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lspci.8.html) manual pages will tell you that -t show a tree-like diagram containing all buses, bridges, devices and connections between them whereas -v display detailed information about all devices. So we end up with a tree like structure of named devices which allows us track down the PCIe Root Port and its address. In this case it should be written as `0000:17:00.0`.

For easy turning on and off DDIO on per-PCIe Root Port basis you can use [ddio.sh](https://github.com/janekmi/rpma/blob/common-tools-ddio/tools/ddio.sh) available in the RPMA repository.

```sh
$ PCIe_Root_Port=0000:17:00.0
$ sudo ./ddio -d $PCIe_Root_Port -q
$ echo $?
1
```

The `1` at the end of the output in this case means the DDIO feature is turned on for this PCIe Root Port which is the default for today Intel platforms. But you want to turn it off for each system which PMem you want to access directly via RDMA. For details please see [rpma_peer_cfg_set_direct_write_to_pmem(3)](https://pmem.io/rpma/manpages/master/rpma_peer_cfg_set_direct_write_to_pmem.3) and [rpma_flush(3)](https://pmem.io/rpma/manpages/master/rpma_flush.3).

```sh
$ sudo /.ddio -d $PCIe_Root_Port -s disable
$ sudo ./ddio -d $PCIe_Root_Port -q
$ echo $?
0
```
