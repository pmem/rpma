# THREAD SAFETY

This document presents the analysis of thread safety of the librpma library.

**Note**: the analysis is based on static code analysis and a set of multithreaded tests executed under Ubuntu 22.04.
In order to confirm thread safety on another OS configuration, all multithreaded tests should be rerun.
Detected and masked multithreading issues can be seen in the following suppression files:
- [drd.supp](tests/drd.supp) and
- [helgrind.supp](tests/helgrind.supp)

## Main assumptions

The main assumptions this analysis is based on are following:

1) the API of libibverbs is fully thread-safe and it can be called from every thread in the process (see [Relationship of libibverbs and librdmacm](#relationship-of-libibverbs-and-librdmacm) for details)
2) many threads may use the same peer (`struct rpma_peer`) to create separate connections,
3) there can be only one endpoint (`struct rpma_ep`) and only one thread can use it (call `rpma_ep_next_conn_req()` on it),
4) each of the connections (`struct rpma_conn_req` and `struct rpma_conn`) can be used by only one thread at the same time.

**If the above assumptions are not met, thread safety of the librpma library is not guaranteed.**

The most common scenarios are following:
1) on the active side: the main thread creates connection requests (`struct rpma_conn_req`) for all threads and pass them to those threads which use them to create separate connections (`struct rpma_conn`),
2) on the passive side: the main thread establishes the connection but the rest of work (including connection shutdown) is done by separate thread(s) (if more than one connection is established).

Most of the core librpma API calls are thread-safe but there are also very important exceptions (described below) mainly related to connection's configuration, establishment and tear-down.

Creating resources of RPMA library usually involves dynamic memory allocation and destroying resources usually involves a dynamic memory release. The same resource cannot be destroyed more than once at any thread and a resource cannot be used after it was destroyed. It is the user's responsibility to follow those rules and not doing so may result in a segmentation fault or an undefined behaviour.

## Conditionally thread-safe API calls

**Note**: Thread safety of the following functions depends on the support of atomic operations (`atomic_store` and `atomic_load`) on the specific OS. If it is supported then they are all (except rpma_conn_req_connect) thread-safe .

The following API calls of the librpma library:
- rpma_peer_cfg_set_direct_write_to_pmem
- rpma_peer_cfg_get_direct_write_to_pmem
- rpma_peer_cfg_get_descriptor
- rpma_conn_apply_remote_peer_cfg - calls rpma_peer_cfg_get_direct_write_to_pmem

are thread-safe only if each thread operates on a **separate peer configuration structure** (`struct rpma_peer_cfg`) used only by this one thread. They are not thread-safe if threads operate on one peer configuration structure common for more than one thread.

The following API calls of the librpma library:
- rpma_conn_cfg_get_compl_channel
- rpma_conn_cfg_get_cq_size
- rpma_conn_cfg_get_rcq_size
- rpma_conn_cfg_get_rq_size
- rpma_conn_cfg_get_sq_size
- rpma_conn_cfg_get_timeout
- rpma_conn_cfg_set_compl_channel
- rpma_conn_cfg_set_cq_size
- rpma_conn_cfg_set_rcq_size
- rpma_conn_cfg_set_rq_size
- rpma_conn_cfg_set_sq_size
- rpma_conn_cfg_set_timeout

are thread-safe only if each thread operates on a **separate connection configuration structure** (`struct rpma_conn_cfg`) used only by this one thread. They are not thread-safe if threads operate on one connection configuration structure common for more than one thread.

The following API call of the librpma library:
- rpma_conn_req_connect

is thread-safe only if each thread operates on a **separate connection request** (`struct rpma_conn_req`) used only by this one thread. They are not thread-safe if threads operate on one connection request common for more than one thread.

## NOT thread-safe API calls

The following API calls of the librpma library are NOT thread-safe:
- rpma_conn_req_new
- rpma_conn_req_delete
- rpma_ep_listen
- rpma_ep_next_conn_req
- rpma_ep_shutdown
- rpma_mr_reg
- rpma_mr_dereg
- rpma_utils_get_ibv_context

### rpma_log_default_function()

The `rpma_log_default_function()` function is used throughout the API:
- at the stage of detecting errors and warnings *LOG_LEVEL_WARNING/ERROR*
- when establishing connections *LOG_LEVEL_NOTICE*

In the first case, when we set *LOG_LEVEL_WARNING/ERROR* the function will be called only in error situations. So there is no risk to normal operation.

In the second case, we call the function in functions that are marked as not thread-safe.

The `rpma_log_default_function()` function is NOT thread-safe because it uses the [localtime_r(3)](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Broken_002ddown-Time.html#index-localtime_005fr) and [syslog(3)](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/syslog_003b-vsyslog.html#index-syslog) functions which are labeled as **MT-Safe env locale**.

According to [Safety Remarks](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Other-Safety-Remarks.html) documentation:
- `env`:
	Functions marked with env as an MT-Safety issue access the environment with getenv or similar, without any guards to ensure safety in the presence of concurrent modifications.

	We do not mark these functions as MT- or AS-Unsafe, however, because functions that modify the environment are all marked with const:env and regarded as unsafe. Being unsafe, the latter are not to be called when multiple threads are running or asynchronous signals are enabled, and so the environment can be considered effectively constant in these contexts, which makes the former safe.
- `locale`:
	Functions annotated with locale as an MT-Safety issue read from the locale object without any form of synchronization. Functions annotated with locale called concurrently with locale changes may behave in ways that do not correspond to any of the locales active during their execution, but an unpredictable mix thereof.

	We do not mark these functions as MT- or AS-Unsafe, however, because functions that modify the locale object are marked with const:locale and regarded as unsafe. Being unsafe, the latter are not to be called when multiple threads are running or asynchronous signals are enabled, and so the locale can be considered effectively constant in these contexts, which makes the former safe.
